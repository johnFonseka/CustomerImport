# Magento / PHP Technical Excercise

## Implementation - Summery

Hello, I am John Fonseka and this is my solution to the task given. However There is a 
slight difference to the command. I couldn't find a way to get nameless arguments. Hence please find 
the below command to get the solution work. 

```
bin/magento customer:import -p sample-csv -f sample.csv
bin/magento customer:import -p sample-json -f sample.json
```
In here `-p` is for **profile** and `-f` is for **file**. 

It took me about 8 hours to finish this plugin despite 4 hour time limit.
